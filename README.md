# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

## 📌 Overview
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around **objects** rather than functions and logic. An object is a **data structure** that contains both **data (attributes)** and **functions (methods)** that operate on the data. OOP makes code **reusable, scalable, and modular**.

## 🔑 Key Concepts of OOP

### 🏛 1. Classes and Objects
- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects (defines attributes & methods).
- **Object**: An instance of a class.

```python
# Defining a Class and Creating an Object
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def bark(self):
        print("Woof!")

my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 3)
my_dog.bark()  # Output: Woof!
```

### 🔒 2. Encapsulation (Data Hiding)
Encapsulation ensures that an object's data is protected by restricting direct access and allowing modification only through controlled methods.

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.__balance += amount

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance  # Accessor method

account = BankAccount(100)
account.deposit(50)
print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 150
```
🔹 Private attributes (__balance) cannot be accessed directly.
🔹 Methods (get_balance()) allow controlled access.

### 🏗 3. Inheritance (Code Reusability)
Inheritance allows a class (child class) to reuse properties & methods from another class (parent class).

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        pass  # Placeholder for derived classes

class Dog(Animal):  # Dog inherits from Animal
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof!"

my_dog = Dog("Buddy")
print(my_dog.speak())  # Output: Woof!
```
🔹 Single Inheritance: One class inherits from another.
🔹 Multiple Inheritance: A class inherits from multiple parent classes.
🔹 Multilevel Inheritance: Inheritance chain (A → B → C).
🔹 Hierarchical Inheritance: One parent class, multiple child classes.

### 🔁 4. Polymorphism (Many Forms)
Polymorphism allows the same method name to behave differently in different classes.

```python

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow!"

animals = [Dog("Buddy"), Cat("Whiskers")]

for animal in animals:
    print(animal.speak())  # Output: Woof! Meow!
```
🔹 Method Overriding – Child class redefines a method from the parent class.
🔹 Method Overloading – Not natively supported in Python but can be simulated using default arguments.

### 🎭 5. Abstraction (Hiding Complexity)
Abstraction hides implementation details and only exposes the necessary features.
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):  # Abstract Class
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass  # Must be implemented in child classes

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2

my_circle = Circle(5)
print(my_circle.area())  # Output: 78.5

```
🔹 Abstract classes cannot be instantiated.
🔹 Forces subclasses to implement the abstract method (area()).

✅ Benefits of OOP
✔ Modularity – Code is divided into reusable classes.
✔ Reusability – Existing classes can be extended to new functionality.
✔ Scalability – Code can be easily modified or extended.
✔ Security – Encapsulation restricts unauthorized access.

🎯 Conclusion
Object-Oriented Programming in Python provides a powerful and structured approach to software development. By using encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, developers can build efficient, maintainable, and scalable applications. 🚀
